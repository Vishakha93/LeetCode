Q. How does one computer send number 5 to another?
A. Use a wire to send 101.
Send an on pulse & waiting
Send nothing & waiting
Send an on pulse & waiting

As long as 2 computers agree on the time period, then they can transfer information to each other, turning binary data into pulses 
and pulses into binary data.

## Bit Rate
Computer Networks can send bits very fast. We measure that speed using bit rate, the number of bits of data that are sent each second.
Earliest Internet Connection Speed - 75 bps
My Current Internet Connection Speed - 27 Mbps i.e. 27 Million bits per second

## Bandwidth
It is the maximum bit rate of a system. If a network connection has a bandwidth of 100 Mbps, that means it can't transfer more than 100 megabits per second.
"Boardband Internet" has a minimum bandwidth of 256 kbps - Enough for basic internet use like checking emails and readinf websites
Watching online videos needs more bandwidth

## Latency
Latency of a network is the time between the sending of a data message and receiving of that message measured in milliseconds.
My Computer -----> Google Server = 30ms
Google Server ----> My Computer = 40ms
Total Round Trip Latency = 70ms

Latency depends on type of connection between my computer and Google, distance from my computer to Google servers, the congestion in the network.
