Load Balancer improves the availability and responsiveness of an application by
1. Distributing the traffic
2. Track status of servers. Stop sending traffic to server which has elevated error rate or is not responding.

We can add LBs at 3 places
1. Between the user and the web server
2. Between the web server and an internal platform layer like application server or cache servers
3. Between the internal platform layer and database

Benefits of Load Balancing

Users - Experience faster(higher throuput) and uninteruppted(less downtime) service. Users won't have to wait for a single server to finish its previous tasks.
Organization - Smart LBs provide predict traffic bottlenecks which are about to happen, providing actionable insights
System Admins - Experience fewer failed and stressed components
